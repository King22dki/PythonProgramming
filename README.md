# Python Programming

This repository contains my progress and practice files as I work through the "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" course. I'm using this to learn and improve my Python programming skills.

## Course Resource

I'm following the video course: [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qHMXu99d88)

## Repository Contents

- `AutomateWithPython2.py`: Practice file for Part 6 of the course
- `Booleans.py`: Exercises related to Boolean logic in Python
- `FlowChart.py`: Another practice file for Part 6 of the course
- `hello.py`: Initial "Hello World" style script

## Progress

Currently, I've completed up to Part 6 of the course. The repository will be updated regularly as I progress through the course and complete more exercises.

## Topics Covered

- Basic Python syntax
- Variables and data types
- Boolean logic
- Control flow (if statements, loops)
- Functions
- (More topics will be added as I progress)

## Flowcharts

The `flowchart` folder contains visual representations of some programming concepts or algorithms I've learned. These help in understanding the logic flow in Python programs.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to explore the different Python files. To run any of the `.py` files, make sure you have Python installed on your system, then use the command:

```
python filename.py
```

Replace `filename.py` with the name of the file you want to run.

## Goals

- Complete the "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" course
- Gain proficiency in Python programming
- Apply Python to automate everyday tasks
- Build a portfolio of Python projects

## Notes

- The `.idea` folder is created by PyCharm IDE and can be ignored if you're not using PyCharm.
- Comments in the code explain what each section does and any important concepts.

## Contributions

While this is primarily a personal learning repository, feedback and suggestions are welcome. If you notice any errors or have ideas for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Happy Python coding!
